# 🚀 GitHub PR Analyzer
A powerful tool for analyzing GitHub pull requests using AI-powered code analysis.

## 📝 Project Description
The GitHub PR Analyzer is a web application that utilizes AI-powered code analysis to evaluate pull requests on GitHub. It leverages the power of FastAPI, Django, and Celery to provide a scalable and efficient solution for analyzing code quality, detecting bugs, and suggesting improvements.

## 🌟 Key Features and Capabilities
* Analyze GitHub pull requests using AI-powered code analysis
* Detect bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues
* Provide suggestions for improvement and code optimization
* Utilize Celery for task queue management and asynchronous processing
* Support for GitHub API integration for fetching pull request data

## 🛠️ Technologies and Dependencies Used
* FastAPI for building the frontend service
* Django for building the backend service
* Celery for task queue management and asynchronous processing
* GitHub API for fetching pull request data
* Groq for AI-powered code analysis

## 📚 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/taradepan/github-pr-analyzer.git`
2. Create a `.env` file and add your Groq API key
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the FastAPI service using `uvicorn main:app --reload`
5. Run the Django service using `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001`
6. Run the Celery worker using `celery -A django_app worker -l info -P eventlet`

## 📊 Usage Guide
1. Send a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:8001/start_task/` with the following JSON data:
```json
{
    "repo_url": "https://github.com/<username>/<reponame>",
    "pr_number": <pr-number>,
    "github_token": null
}
```
2. Get the task status using `http://127.0.0.1:8001/task_status/<task_id>/`
3. Get the task result using `http://127.0.0.1:8001/task_result/<task_id>/`

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines
* Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
* Write clear and concise commit messages
* Use Markdown formatting for documentation and comments
* Test your code thoroughly before submitting a pull request

## 📝 Additional Notes and Tips
* Make sure to replace `<username>` and `<reponame>` with your actual GitHub repository credentials
* Use a valid GitHub token for authentication
* Be patient while the AI-powered code analysis is running, as it may take some time to complete

👍 Happy coding! 🚀
